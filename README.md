# DIverseEvol-Iterative-Training-Dataset-Refinement
DIverseEvol is a novel approach for iteratively refining training datasets using model-driven feedback and embedding-space exploration. The method evolves the dataset over multiple cycles to ensure higher diversity, representativeness, and quality, ultimately leading to more robust model performance.
